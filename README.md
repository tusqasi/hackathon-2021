# TEAM Hackerz Prototype for TECHNOVATION hackathon

This the prototype of a basic road and traffic safety.  

This prototype uses multiple haar cascade classifier to detect different entities in the frame.

When a human is found a warning is emitted.

## Cascade classifier
These are entity recognizers. These recognize features starting from large feature going through small features. 

It stops when any large feature doesn't match it skips the entity, when all larger features are matched it start this process with smaller features.
